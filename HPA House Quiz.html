A sudden hiss alerts you to a presence behind you. Turning around, you see a fierce little badger, baring its teeth at you.

The badger crouches down, as if preparing to lunge at you. Before it has the chance to, however, you walk towards it, waving your stick around. The badger seems very unnerved and backs away. Throwing your stick at the badger seems to do the trick, and it scurries off.

You find a box of matches in your pocket. With five matches left, you quickly start up the fire. The sun is getting close to the horizon.

The trees seem a bit more menacing in the low light, but this doesn&#39;t keep you from entering the forest. Searching around for a bit yields questionable results, though you do manage to find a few eatable berries. Satisfied, you go back to your camp and sleep.

It narrows its eyes at you, having deemed you the new enemy. As it runs towards you again, you jab your branch at it threateningly.

<tw-passagedata pid="56" name="Exploration yay" tags="" position="800,1000">You walk through the ruins, looking for any signs of the civilization that must have built it. Your search is rewarded when you find a somewhat intact wall with what looks like chicken-scratches. You can&#39;t decipher it though, and after a while, you leave the place.

<tw-passagedata pid="57" name="Definitely boring" tags="" position="850,1250">You eye the ruins warily, not wanting to stay around longer than necessary. You leave the rubble behind, and continue through the forest.

<tw-passagedata pid="58" name="Treasure??" tags="" position="950,1100">You walk around the crumbled rocks, scanning the area briefly for anything shiny. A quick flash of light catches your eyes, and you go closer to inspect. An intricate golden clock lies between the rubble, not in working condition, but it&#39;s gold nonetheless.

<tw-passagedata pid="59" name="Continue06" tags="" position="600,1150">As you walk away from the ruins, you notice a circular clearing, devoid of trees. In the middle stands a pedestal with a large tome on it.
What will you do?

[[Read it! It might contain something interesting.|Reading is for nerds]]
[[Leave it. I don&#39;t have time for reading.|Leave book]]
[[Burn it! Burn it to the ground!|Burn baby burn]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Reading is for nerds" tags="" position="450,1400">You approach the book carefully, giving it a quick once-over. The book is covered in something that looks like fur, and the title reads &quot;Monster Book of Monsters&quot;. You try to open the book, before it suddenly seems to come to life, snapping at you agressively. As it chases you, you run for your life.

[[Continue|Continue07]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Leave book" tags="" position="600,1350">You look briefly at the book, reading over the title. &quot;Monster Book of Monsters&quot;. The furry exterior seems slightly concerning, and you decide to leave the book alone.

<tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Burn baby burn" tags="" position="750,1400">You grab a box of matches from your pocket, briefly wondering why you&#39;re actually doing this. Oh, well, maybe the book could be dangerous? Leaving a burning match on the furry cover, you walk away from the fire in style.

<tw-passagedata pid="63" name="Continue07" tags="" position="600,1550">You look up at the sky and realise that you should find somewhere to sleep.
What will you do?

[[Sleep on the ground.|Is this a good idea?]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="64" name="Sleeping in the trees... again" tags="" position="650,1850">You walk around the trees for a bit, until you find a satisfactorily sturdy one. Climbing into the tree, you find a large branch and sleep.

[[Continue|Continue03]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="65" name="Spooky" tags="" position="750,1700">You backtrack your way through the forest, finding a place amongst the crumbled buildings. You find a place that effectively blocks the wind, and fall asleep, hoping that the ruins won&#39;t collapse while you sleep.

[[Continue|Continue03]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="66" name="Is this a good idea?" tags="" position="900,1600">You look around. The forest seems very calm and quiet. Deciding that this spot is as good as any, you lie down on the soft forest floor, quickly falling asleep.

[[Continue|Continue03]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Trails" tags="" position="1550,2100">You crouch down to examine the ground. Several footprints from deer seem to lead towards the inner part of the forest. You get up, and decide to follow the path.

[[Continue|Continue08]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Continue08" tags="" position="1500,2300">As you get deeper into the woods, you suddenly come to a halt. A deep lake stretches out before you. You approach the lake, crouching down to take some water. Something abruptly pulls you into the water, and your vision fades to black.

When you open your eyes again, you realise that you&#39;re on a train. A train to Hogwarts, school of magic and wizardry. A girl pops her head into your cabin.
&quot;Oh, hey! You woke up!&quot;
What will you say?

[[&quot;Who are you?&quot;|Who??]]
[[&quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;d like to be alone, please.&quot;|Alone]]

&quot;I&#39;m Madison! I was just passing by earlier and noticed you were asleep. Would you like me to leave, or?...&quot;
What will you say?

[[&quot;No, it&#39;s alright. Please stay.&quot;|Please Stay]]
[[&quot;Yeah... I&#39;ll see you later!&quot;|Go away Madison]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="70" name="Alone" tags="" position="1400,2500">&quot;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;d like to be alone, please.&quot;
&quot;Oh... That&#39;s alright!&quot; the girl says with a shy smile, before closing the door and leaving you with your thoughts.
What will you do?

[[Stare out the window.|Window peeking]]
[[Read a book.|More books!]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Troll" tags="" position="1600,2500">&quot;Could you call the food trolly, please?&quot;
The girl smiles at you cheerfully.
&quot;Sure&quot; she says, as she closes the door to your cabin, leaving you alone in the room.
What will you do?

&quot;Not really the talkative type, eh? It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ll leave you alone. I&#39;m Madison, by the way.&quot; she adds with a smile.
What will you say?

[[&quot;No, it&#39;s alright. Please stay.&quot;|Please Stay]]

<tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Please Stay" tags="" position="1350,2850">&quot;No, it&#39;s alright. Please stay.&quot;
She bouces inside your small cabin, and sits down in the seat opposite to yours.
&quot;So do you have any pets?&quot;
What will you say?

[[&quot;No I don&#39;t. Why is this relevant?&quot;|No pets]]
[[&quot;Yes, I have a dog.&quot;|Dog]]
[[&quot;I own a canary bird! It&#39;s really noisy.&quot;|Birds!]]
[[&quot;I have a cat. It&#39;s very independant.&quot;|Cat]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="75" name="Window peeking" tags="" position="1400,2700">You stare out the window with unfocused eyes, as the terrain passes by. Most of the surroundings are filled with pine trees, and the sun is still high in the sky.
You find your MP3 player, and scroll through your music library.
What will you listen to?

She frowns lightly at you, but takes the silence as a request to leave. As she closes the door to your cabin, you are left with your own thoughts.
What will you do?
